# AI-ML Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **AI/ML Learning Journey**!  
This repository documents my step-by-step learning of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** — from Python basics to advance-level ML models.

I’ll be updating this repo **weekly** with notes, exercises, and mini-projects.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in **Python**, **Math**, and **Statistics**.  
- Learn core **ML algorithms and concepts**.  
- Apply knowledge through **mini-projects and exercises**.  
- Document progress for **GitHub & LinkedIn sharing**.

## 📅 1-Month Plan (Week-wise)

### **Week 1: Python & Math Refresher**
- Python basics: `print`, variables, loops, functions  
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples  
- Simple class (OOP intro)  
- **Exercise:** Mean, Median, Mode calculation (without libraries)
- Some tweaks with data and all  
📂 Folder: `Week01_Basics`  

### **Week 2: Data Visualization & Statistics**
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for plots  
- Probability distributions, correlation, covariance  
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
📂 Folder: `Week02_DataViz_Stats`  

### **Week 3: Regression Models**
- Linear Regression, Cost function, Gradient Descent  
- Evaluation metrics: R², MSE, MAE  
- **Mini-project:** House Price Prediction  
📂 Folder: `Week03_Regression`  

### **Week 4: Classification Basics**
- Logistic Regression, Decision Boundary  
- Train/Test split, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
- **Mini-project:** Spam Email Classifier  
📂 Folder: `Week04_Classification`

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## 💡 How to Use This Repo

1. Navigate to the **week folder** you want to study.  
2. Open the **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** for exercises and code examples.  
3. Read the `notes.md` for quick explanations and theory.  
4. **Modify the code** and experiment to deepen understanding!
